# Consciousness

## TODO

* [ ] Research more on the topic and do initial brain dump
* [ ] Rewrite and clearly separate into sections

As some researchers have pointed out, the term consciousness is an umbrella term thatâ€™s been overused, and perhaps a lot of its apparent mystery is simply a consequence of trying to denote so many distinct ideas with a single word.

Philosophers and researchers who have pondered deeply about it distinguish at least the following mental phenomena when the term consciousness is used:

* Self-awareness: the ability of a mind to establish object identity on a large set of phenomena, ranging from thoughts to body motions, with the peculiar characteristic that the object being identified is the same object doing the identification. This seems to require the mind to be able to find strong correlations (which are interpreted as causation), between intents in the mind (the script of simulated actions in the real world?), actions arising from the execution of such intents, and other phenomena in the world resulting from such actions.
