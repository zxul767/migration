# Glossary

**AI: **Artificial Intelligence

**DL: **Deep Learning

**Feature**: Any salient aspect of either raw input data (e.g., the brightness of pixels in an image) or a higher-level representation of it (e.g., a measure of symmetry in an image), that is useful in building predictive models.

**ML**: Machine Learning

**Object**: Anything that has identity (i.e., it can be told apart from other objects or class of objects) by virtue of showing consistent patterns across time can be considered an object. At the highest level, dogs and rain have in common the fact that they both display consistent patterns across time (e.g., a dog's physical shape remains pretty much constant over time and so does its basic behaviors; rain is water falling from the sky in more or less the same way). It is this consistency that enables our minds to distinguish and classify them as individual objects.

**Pattern**: Any configuration of consistent information that appears more than once. There are patterns everywhere in our daily life, e.g., traffic lights follow a specific temporal pattern (i.e., a sequence of different light colors that changes and repeats at regular intervals) that makes predictable and useful.
