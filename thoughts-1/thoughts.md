## Key Ideas

{% hint style="info" %}
Thoughts can be regarded as computer processes in our brains that are activated by external sensory input or internal memories (e.g., while dreaming). Such processes can make use of many of the cognitive machinery available in our minds, including our predictive models of the world, our episodic memories of the world, the abstraction and analogy-making machinery that underlies our reasoning capabilities, etc.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Thoughts activate symbols in our minds with various levels of "energy", which depends both on the initial external stimulus and the emotional "charge" associated with them. This is why we can have both fleeting thoughts and deep thoughts that won't leave our heads for several days. Somehow, the combination of the energy levels of all the symbols activated constitutes the overall energy for a thought (or a group of related thoughts), which determines its duration and future re-occurrence.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
As high-level processes that have other cognitive machinery at their disposal, some of which may involve other forms of mind processes, we can see thoughts as complex, dynamic networks of processes, some of which are available to our consciousness (i.e., they're introspectable) while others remain completely hidden in the background.

One of the first things that I started to suspect as I read and thought about the nature of thoughts is that related concepts such as “understanding”, “intelligence” and “thinking” are not binary concepts. People often like to think in dichotomies because it’s easier, but the world is messy and such simplifications are often a hindrance to deeper understanding.

{% hint style="info" %}
As you may have already read in their respective sections in this book, I take the stance that none of these concepts is binary. Instead, I assume that they lie on a continuum, and that when people say something like “animals are stupid”, they’re simply drawing an implicit line on that continuum (which is, of course, very subjective and context-dependent.) This assumption will allow us to better understand the origins and evolution of thoughts (and by extension, perhaps, of intelligence.)
{% endhint %}

Early on in life we might have heard from our parents or teachers that animals don’t think. We might have been told that they act by instinct only, i.e., they have pre-defined ways of reacting to some set of inputs in any given situation; in other words, they are born with some mental circuitry that is fixed for life. 

Of course, if you’ve ever had any pets or interacted with animals in any way, you know this is, in general, a fallacy. Most animals are able to learn things, so their mental circuitry is clearly not fixed.

However, it is true that the flexibility of the learning mechanism in various organisms lies on a continuum which depends on a variety of factors, including the presence of a brain, the amount of neurons in it, its topology, etc. So it is at least plausible to imagine that there was a time when most living organisms had completely rigid circuitry to navigate the world, created purely by pressures of the evolutionary process.

## A brief history of thoughts

### The simplest form of thinking

Imagine an early creature with an extremely primitive form of vision: rather than seeing with high resolution and millions of colors as we do, it is only able to distinguish light from dark, and it reacts to light by moving closer to the source, perhaps to use it for photosynthesis.

Over time, and conditioned by the characteristics of its environment, this behavior would surely evolve and become more nuanced (being able to distinguish colors and perhaps even some simple visual patterns). It would still remain completely predictable, however, as long as no mechanism to store memories and learn was developed. Such a creature would be at the same level of intelligence of most of our current computer programs: deterministic and unable to change their behavior, but perhaps pretty good at solving some very narrow set of tasks.

Creatures like these would definitely be doing some kind of learning in a non conventional sense of the word. Their species as a whole would be learning over long periods of time, guided by the inexorable process of evolution which uses DNA as the mechanism to store “memories” of what the species has found useful for survival. 

{% hint style="info" %}
For a fascinating account of this process and a deeper explanation of this seemingly vague language, see “[The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene)” by Richard Dawkins.
{% endhint %}

Slow as it may be, it is a form of learning and one that is necessary to eventually develop a brain: a mechanism to coordinate information between various organs of a creature, and eventually to store memories and allow for a kind of learning that can happen within the lifetime of the creature.

{% hint style="info" %}
Later on in this chapter, I propose that thoughts can be regarded as somewhat similar to computer processes. 

From that perspective, we might say that these creatures had a very crude form of thoughts (perhaps just the equivalent of simple chips computing some logic function), a very simple kind of process which simply computes an output based on inputs from the environment.

Viewed from this angle, our modern notion of thought is perhaps the ultimate extension of this simple process, with the very important additional ability to access vast amounts of memories stored unconsciously, and with access to (sometimes rather sophisticated) models of the world which are used to predict the very near future.
